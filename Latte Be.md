# The Coffee Value Chain: Commodity and FX Volatility in Emerging Markets

*Do FX and commodity price volatility affect coffee production, exports, and revenues?*

>**hypothesis:** higher FX and commodity price volatility are negatively correlated to production, exports, and revenues.

For this project, we will use data in order to analyze this in the five largest Arabica-growing countries over time:
1. Brazil
2. Colombia
3. Ethiopia
4. Uganda
5. Honduras

## Data: Sources and Exploration
____

### Sources

**[ICE Coffee Futures](https://www.theice.com/products/15/Coffee-C-Futures) :** the world benchmark for Arabica coffe


**[IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm) International Monetary Fund):** system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries (and their citizens) to transact with each other

## To Discuss
____
- FX rate weakness is positively correlated with exports, where local currency is weaker against the dollar as a benchmark. 

- KC (coffee futures) volatility is negatively correlated with production levels. 

- What the data showed or did not show: data validated our initial hypotheses, with some exceptions and caveats.

# Conclusions
____
- Market price and FX volatility is generally intimately correlated to commodity production levels and exports... However, this relationship can be altered by consumer attitudes and choices.

- Different actors/markets/countries react and adapt differently to volatility.
